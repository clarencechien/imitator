# Interactive Report Website (Imitator Themed)
 
This project hosts an interactive website with a Material Design "Imitator" theme, designed to display HTML-based reports. It's built to be easily hosted on GitHub Pages and automatically updates its list of reports.

The landing page (`index.html`) uses Materialize CSS and dynamically links to any HTML files found in the `report/` directory. The list of these reports is automatically generated by a GitHub Action.

## How It Works

1.  **GitHub Action for Report Listing:**
    *   A GitHub Action (defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`) automatically runs whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, specifically if `.html` files in the `report/` directory are added, modified, or removed, or if the workflow itself changes.
    *   This action scans the `report/` directory and generates a file named `report_list.json` in the root of the repository. This JSON file contains a simple list of all `.html` filenames found in the `report/` directory.
    *   The action then commits this updated `report_list.json` back to the repository.

2.  **Landing Page (`index.html`):**
    *   The `index.html` page is styled using Materialize CSS for a modern look and feel.
    *   It contains JavaScript that fetches the `report_list.json` file.
    *   It then dynamically generates a list of links, displayed as Materialize collection items, pointing to each report listed in the JSON file.
    *   This means you no longer need to manually configure API keys or repository names in the script.

## Adding New Reports

1.  Create your interactive HTML report (e.g., generated by a tool like Gemini).
2.  Ensure the report is a single `.html` file.
3.  Place the new `.html` file directly into the `report/` directory in this repository.
4.  Commit and push the changes to your `main` branch (or your repository's default branch).

The GitHub Action will automatically run, update `report_list.json`, and the landing page will reflect the new report(s) once GitHub Pages rebuilds your site.

## Setting Up GitHub Pages

1.  **Ensure your repository is public** (GitHub Pages for private repositories is a paid feature if you need the Action to commit back without issues, though public is generally easier for Pages).
2.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
3.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
4.  In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" (under the "Code and automation" section).
5.  Under "Build and deployment":
    *   For "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    *   For "Branch", select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`), and ensure `/ (root)` is selected for the folder. Ensure this branch is the one where `report_list.json` is being committed by the action.
6.  Click "Save".
7.  GitHub Pages will build your site. It might take a few minutes for the site to become available at the URL shown (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`). The first time the action runs, it will create `report_list.json`; subsequent changes to the `report/` directory will update it.

## Included Reports

*   Initially includes `cursor.html` as an example interactive report. (This will be listed once you add it to the `report/` directory and the action runs).
