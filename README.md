# Interactive Report Website

This project hosts an interactive website designed to display HTML-based reports. It's built to be easily hosted on GitHub Pages.

The landing page (`index.html`) automatically discovers and links to any HTML files placed in the `report/` directory.

## How It Works

The `index.html` page uses JavaScript to:
1.  Fetch the list of files in the `report/` directory of this GitHub repository using the GitHub API.
2.  Dynamically generate a list of links to any `.html` files found.
3.  Display these links, allowing users to navigate to the individual reports.

**Important:** For the dynamic listing to work on your GitHub Pages site, you **must** update the placeholder values in `index.html`. Near the bottom of `index.html`, find the following lines and replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and the name of this repository:

```javascript
// TODO: Replace with your actual GitHub username and repository name
const githubUsername = 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME';
const githubRepo = 'YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME';
```

## Adding New Reports

1.  Create your interactive HTML report (e.g., generated by a tool like Gemini).
2.  Ensure the report is a single `.html` file.
3.  Place the new `.html` file directly into the `report/` directory in this repository.
4.  Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

The landing page will automatically detect the new file and add a link to it.

## Setting Up GitHub Pages

1.  **Ensure your repository is public** (GitHub Pages for private repositories is a paid feature).
2.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
3.  Click on the "Settings" tab.
4.  In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" (under the "Code and automation" section).
5.  Under "Build and deployment":
    *   For "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    *   For "Branch", select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`), and ensure `/ (root)` is selected for the folder.
6.  Click "Save".
7.  GitHub Pages will build your site. It might take a few minutes for the site to become available at the URL shown (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`).

If `index.html` is not at the root of your deployment branch, GitHub Pages might not serve it correctly as the default page. Ensure `index.html` is in the root of the branch you are deploying from.

## Included Reports

*   Initially includes `cursor.html` as an example interactive report.
